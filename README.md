4. **Start the development server:**

   This will start the application in development mode and open it in your default web browser. The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

5. **Build the project for production:**
   To create an optimized production build of the application, run:

   ```
   This will create a `build` folder containing the production-ready files.

6. **Run tests:**
   To run the tests for the application, use:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   This will launch the test runner in interactive watch mode.

7. **Eject the configuration (optional):**
   If you need to customize the configuration, you can eject it by running:
   ```bash
   npm run eject
   ```
   **Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!
